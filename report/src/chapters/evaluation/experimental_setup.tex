\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:eval-setup}

This section describes the configuration of the experiments conducted to evaluate the \textit{Invox} system under different orchestration strategies. All evaluations were executed using the preprocessed MUC-4 dataset described in Section~\ref{sec:eval-dataset} and the embedding-based metrics defined in Section~\ref{sec:eval-metrics}.  
The setup ensures comparability across strategies by maintaining identical model parameters, embedding configurations, and evaluation scripts.

\subsection{Compared Strategies}

The \textit{Invox} system supports multiple extraction strategies that differ in how they allocate reasoning effort across large-language-model (LLM) calls. Each strategy is evaluated independently but within the same pipeline, demonstrating the modular nature of the architecture.  

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{S1: Single-Pass Full Input} — the entire document is processed in a single inference step using one LLM instance. This approach minimizes latency and cost but provides limited internal verification.
    \item \textbf{S2: Iterative Single-Field} — each field is extracted sequentially in separate LLM calls. This allows focused reasoning for difficult slots such as \texttt{perpetratorIndividual} or \texttt{target}, often improving precision at the cost of longer inference time.
    \item \textbf{S3: Multi-LLM Consensus (Full)} — multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5) process the entire input independently. The Verification Agent aggregates their results via consensus scoring to improve overall reliability.
    \item \textbf{S4: Multi-LLM Per-Field} — similar to S3 but the consensus process operates at the field level, combining specialized model outputs per slot. This configuration provides the most granular control over extraction quality.
    \item \textbf{S5: LangExtract Baseline} — a non-LLM rule-based extraction pipeline used as an external baseline. It relies on handcrafted patterns and regular expressions and serves to contextualize the semantic improvements achieved by \textit{Invox}.
\end{itemize}

All strategies share the same input format and produce outputs following the schema 
(\texttt{incidentType}, \texttt{incidentDate}, \texttt{incidentLocation}, \texttt{incidentStage}, \texttt{perpetratorIndividual}, \texttt{perpetratorOrganization}, \texttt{target}, \texttt{victim}, \texttt{weapon}).  
This unified design enables a direct, component-wise comparison of accuracy, latency, and cost.

\subsection{Embedding Models}

Semantic similarity between predicted and reference fillers is computed using the \texttt{sentence-transformers} library.  
The primary encoder is \texttt{all-MiniLM-L6-v2}, chosen for its balance between speed and representational quality.  
To verify metric robustness, a secondary encoder, \texttt{multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1}, was used for cross-checking.  
Both models produce 384-dimensional embeddings normalized to unit length, ensuring that cosine similarity values fall within the range [0, 1].  
Empirical tests showed that the two encoders produce nearly identical ranking orders across strategies, confirming the stability of the evaluation results.

\subsection{Environment and Settings}

All experiments were run on a CPU-only Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS machine (kernel 6.14) with an Intel i7-6600U (2 cores, 4 threads), 16\,GB RAM, and integrated Intel HD 520 graphics (no discrete NVIDIA GPU / no CUDA). Local preprocessing and evaluation were implemented in Python~3.10; the orchestration service was built with Node.js~20 (TypeScript).

Model inference used hosted APIs (OpenAI, Gemini) with deterministic settings (\texttt{temperature=0.2}, \texttt{top-p=1.0}) and fixed random seeds for reproducibility. Latency was measured at the API boundary per document (request--response wall time, including network). Token usage and provider-reported pricing were logged to estimate cost. All strategies used identical batching and concurrency to avoid scheduling bias.
