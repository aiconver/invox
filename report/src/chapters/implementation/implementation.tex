The conceptual architecture introduced in the previous chapter provides the theoretical foundation for transforming unstructured speech into structured templates. This chapter shifts focus from design to realization, demonstrating how the multi-agent pipeline was implemented in practice. The implementation details cover technology selection, system workflow, concrete agent implementations, and the realization of the four architectural strategies. Finally, challenges and key design decisions encountered during development are discussed.
