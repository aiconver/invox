The conceptual architecture introduced in the previous chapter provides the theoretical foundation for transforming unstructured speech into structured templates. In this chapter, the focus shifts from design to realization. The aim is to demonstrate how the multi-agent pipeline was implemented in practice, which technologies were selected, and how the agents and strategies were instantiated within a working system. The following sections cover the technology stack, the overall system workflow, the concrete implementation of agents, and the realization of the four architectural strategies. Finally, challenges and design decisions encountered during development are discussed.
